# lastfm-widget

A tiny last.fm widget

## Why

Because I can and I want (a small widget to display my most listened albums, artists or songs on my website).

## Get started

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.2. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
